# Employee Management System (PWA)
CREA EMS is an online employee management platform that seeks to optimize and streamline process by minimising human error through automation and reduction of paperwork. It will also aid the administrators in resource management, which includes manpower allocation, payroll computation and analytics reports.

## Project Description
Our project aims to optimize and streamline the shift booking process in CREA by building an Employee Management System (EMS), which is a web application to replace its existing manual shift booking system (Google Sheets).

The EMS will be able to provide analytical reports on employee performance. This interactive dashboard provides a quick visual representation of employee performance, providing the manager with insights for better planning and management of employee schedules.

Additionally, the EMS will be developed as a Progressive Web Application, allowing for students to use the EMS on their phones as if it were a native mobile application. This allows the EMS to provide push notifications to remind students of their time slot bookings.

## Project Motivation
Shift booking confirmation is mandatory at the end of every week. At the end of every month, it requires up to 5 days to manuall cross-check the paper timestamps with the an Online Clocking System (CATS) to tally the hours while referencing their call logs to determine their performance each hour. Thus, with the auto-computation of hours, and with respect to the CATS requirement, this would save the hassle of cross-checking each employee individually with a paper timesheet.

The automation process and use of the analytical dashboard would bring greater value to the manager, giving a bird's-eye view of the performance of all employees. As other off-the-shelf management tools available in the industry like BookSteam, Findmyshift, monday.com and etc, are costly and not within CREA's project budget, this was created to fulfill the need of an alternative, low-cost custom-developed software.
